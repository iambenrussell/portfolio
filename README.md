# Ben Russell: UX Designer and Web Developer

Hi, thanks for stopping by!

My name is Ben. I'm a DFW-area UX designer with additional experience in web development, project management, and QA. After graduating from the University of Oklahoma with a master's degree in Economics and Data Analytics, I spent three years as a product manager at a local tech startup. In this role, I had a number of responsibilities, including web design and development. My goal for 2021 is to continue building these skills while also working on some great products.

This site is still under construction. For now, feel free to take a look at my projects at https://iambenrussell.github.io. You can also reach out at brrussell93@gmail.com if you'd like to chat!
